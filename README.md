# devops-challenge

## Challenge 1
Javier is a __Python__ developer who has built a web application in __Flask__ to launch a "Hello World". Javier needs your help as a DevOp to __deploy the application__ on AWS. Make the necessary adjustments to be able to deploy the application. Please consider the following:
1. Download the application locally.
2. Generate a Dockerfile.
3. Build and run the image locally (use __docker-compose__).


## Challenge 2
If the above was successful, __explain__ how you would do to __deploy the application__ on AWS (if you don't have experience with AWS, explain how you would do it on other platforms)

## Challenge 3
If you still have time:
1. modify the image using a __distroless__ version (https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
2. Explain the benefits of using these types of images.
